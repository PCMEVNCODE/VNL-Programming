VNL PROJECT – Danh Dev  
Conceived and developed by Danh Dev in 06/2025

VNL (Vietnamese Natural Language) is a programming language developed with Vietnamese commands and syntax at its core. It is designed to be simple, intuitive, and powerful for Vietnamese developers, especially in fields such as embedded systems, AI, software, and web development.

Goals:
- Develop VNL version 1.0.0
- Complete language core and continuous updates
- Apply VNL language to embedded programming, including MCU, SoC, and others
- Expand VNL usage in software, web, AI, and automation
- Strengthen the Vietnamese developer community with a truly native programming tool

VNL Compilation Process:
1. Source Code (.vnl)
2. Word Splitting / Tokenization
3. Conversion to Bytecode (.vnlb)
4. Sytax and Logic and safety checks
5. Execution by VNL Virtual Machine (VVM)
6. Output Result

Note:
VNL aims to maintain strict control over language structure to prevent fragmentation and ensure consistency across all projects. The language is designed and defined solely by Danh Dev to maintain vision, clarity, and long-term stability.

Quote from Creator:
"VNL is not just a language. It is the foundation for a Vietnamese-led programming revolution."
